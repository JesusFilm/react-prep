# Getting Started

## Intro

Hello and welcome, I'm so excited that you're embarking on this journey of becoming a developer!

## Setting the Scene

The contents of this is to prepare you to make your own first front end react application. As such it is focused on the practical aspects of this and not so much of how things are working "under the hood".

The contents of this is to help you to facilitate your own learning, no one will be checking/ grading your work (you can always ask for help though!). To help you achieve this, my chief encouragement for you is:

> **Be curious!**

Wonder how else the code could be used? Thought of a edge case that may break the code? Want to combine some code together to see what happens? Try it all!!!

The recommended time is how much time you should spend on that task. If you find yourself spending longer, I encourage you to just move on to the next task. It is much better that you get chance to have a go at everything here, than miss out on the last few tasks. (You can always come back once you've completed all the sections)
