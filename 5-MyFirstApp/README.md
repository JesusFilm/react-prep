Now that we've created a react app together, its time for you to have a go yourself. Try out one of the ideas below, or come up with one yourself!

> If you find your self getting stuck, try scour youtube for some tutorials of your project. Eg [react todo app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1E08i2UJGI)

Spend as long (or short) as you want on this. Remember, _be curious_, and have some fun as you try stuff out.

## Creating a project

1. Create a new repo on github
2. Open the repo on your VS code
3. Run the following command to create your react app, follow the prompts from the terminal.
   ```
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```
   > Follow [this](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) if you get stuck
4. Run the project
   ```
   cd my-app
   npm start
   ```
   > As you start creating your apps, you may run into some new concepts we haven't covered. Here's some resources that you can check out if you get stuck on them
