# What its all led to

## First try

1. Have a look at the react app in this folder
2. TODO: add instructions walking through creating a basic react app <!-- include importing mui library and use some componets from there -->

## Now your turn

1. Create a new repo
2. Run `run create react-app`
3. Make anything you want! I suggested a CV page.
4. Stretch: Deploy via github
5. Strech: Look into react hooks
