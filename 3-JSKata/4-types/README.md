# Kata: Types and Functions

This challenge is designed to practice familiarity with types and functions.

## Common functions for arrays

The last three tests walk you through implementing 3 common functions we use on arrays:

1. [`Array.map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
2. [`Array.filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
3. [`Array.find`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find)

** Do not use the built in array functions, instead write your own using loops and conditionals **


## Clean up

To run all of the tests for all of the functions you've written and exported, in terminal run:

```
npm test tests
```

This will run all tests in the `tests` directory.

Once you have all the tests passing, read your code through carefully and ensure you understand how it all works. Can you refactor any of your code (for example, any duplication)?
