# Kata: Data Structures

This challenge is designed to practice interacting with JavaScript objects, pulling values from objects and testing the outcome of these in controlled tests.

## The first test

Hopefuly you're getting used tothe flow of completing these activities now, have a look back at the other projects for a refresher.

## Next steps

When working through these, it is important that you make sure you **look at the tests** that have been written and understand what is being asked of each function.

If you'd like to work on the tests in an order of increasing difficulty, try this order:

- getType
- getValue
- getAddress
- positions
- getPropTypes
- matrix
- find
- where

## Making sure you're finished

To run all of the tests for all of the functions you've written, in terminal run:

```
npm test 3-tests
```

This will run all tests in the `3-tests` directory. When you have all the tests passing, read your code through carefully and ensure you know everything that is going on. Can you refactor any of it? Does it all make sense to you?
