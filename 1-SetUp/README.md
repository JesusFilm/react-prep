# First things first

## Get the tools

1. Download VS code
2. Get some extensions for VS code
3. Download and set up ZSH

## Github

1. Why is version control important
2. Create your github account
3. Fork this repo into your own account <!-- Add some screenshots on how to do -->
4. Make your first commit
   > - Open repo in VS code
   > - Create a new branch
   > - Make a change <!-- Define more the change that needs to be made here -->
   > - Stage the commit
   > - Add a commit message
   > - Push the commit
   > - Create a new pull request (PR) on github, review and merge.

Note: You can push changes straight to your main branch and don't have to raise a PR to make a change. But most projects you'll be apart of will require you to.
