# Learning the Basics (4hrs 30min)

Reminder: the times besides the sections are **how long you should spend on the section**, **NOT** how long it takes to be completed.

## HTML (1hr)

HTML is the bones of web development. No matter how fancy a website is, this is what it gets distilled down to. We won't actually be coding in this later, but do get familar with it.

## Flexbox (30min)

As you were building out the cat app, you may have notcied the lack of styling. There are many ways to add styling to a web page, however the most relevant to us is flex box. It'll make a lot more sense when you start getting into react (later), but for now, have a go at this game.

## Javascript (3hrs)

Javascript is the language we'll be using for coding, so its pretty important. Complete the following tasks from FreeCodeCamp

> [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript)
>
> - Complete "Comment your Javascript Code” to “Nesting For Loops”
> - Complete "Use Conditional (Ternary) Operator" to "Use Multiple Conditional (Ternary) Operator"
