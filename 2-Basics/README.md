# Learning the Basics (7hrs)

Reminder: the times besides the sections are how long you should spend on the section, **NOT** how long it takes to be completed.

## HTML (2hr)

HTML is the bones of web development. No matter how fancy a website is, this is what it gets distilled down to. We won't actually be coding in this later, but do get familiar with it.

## Flexbox (1hr)

As you were building out the cat app, you may have noticed the lack of styling. There are many ways to add styling to a web page, however the most relevant to us is flex box. Knowing this will become more important as you get into styling your web pages more, but for now, have a go at this game and tuck the info at the back of your mind.
