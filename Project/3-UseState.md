Create a MUI `Switch` component using useState to test your understanding (delete after)

## Form

When the button in the form is clicked a new task should created (and rendered) in the task list.

## TaskCard

A task should be able to be completed, and still viewable in the task list.

A task can also be deleted. When deleted, the task should be removed from the list.

## Hint

Put the task array in a state
