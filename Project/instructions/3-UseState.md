# Use state

[Watch this video](https://youtu.be/O6P86uwfdR0)

Create a MUI `Switch` component using `useState` to test your understanding. You can delete this after as this won't be needed for the actual project.

## Form

When the button in the form is clicked a new timer should be created (and rendered) in the timer list.

## Timer

A timer should start counting down once it's added.

The timer should show that it has finished/completed once it runs to zero and still visible in the timer list.

A timer can also be deleted. When deleted, the timer should be removed from the list.

> [!TIP]
> Put the timer array in a state.
