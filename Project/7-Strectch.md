# Stretch

Just some things to challenge you if you finished all the other tasks already.

## 1. Styling

Are your components styled? Is it something you would show someone? Use the `sx` prop to add additional styling. Make use of flex box for the layout of the page.

## 2. Dialog

The form should be separated from the task list. Convert the `Form` component into a `Dialog` component.

## 3. Reward

We should reward a user for finishing all their tasks!

1. Look through the [list of public API's](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) and find one you think would be a suitable reward for finishing all the tasks

2. Make sure to choose an API that is:

- no for Auth
- yes for https
- no for cors

3. Call the API first to make sure you can get data from it.

4. Once a user completes all the tasks, call the API and display the reward!
