This is to consolidate learnings to be ready to contribute to CORE. This project will be built off the knowledge from the previous modules in a way that it is more alinged to the CORE project.
Key learnings
 - Typescript
 - Material UI
 - UseState/ UseEffect react hooks
 - Async await / callbacks
 - Unit tests
 
 ## Create typescript project
 In the terminal (confirm you're in the correct folder you want to be in, `ls`) paste
  > npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
 Make sure to change the 'my-app' bit 'todo-app' (or something that you want to name it to)
 
 - Create a new folder in src called components, and create a Home component, can return empty fragments for now.
 - in App.tsx
   - Replace boiler plate code with the home component
   - Remove css import, then delete the file app.css file
