This is to consolidate learnings to be ready to contribute to CORE. This project will be built off the knowledge from the previous modules in a way that it is more alinged to the CORE project.
Key learnings
 - Typescript
 - Material UI
 - UseState/ UseEffect react hooks
 - Async await / callbacks
 - Unit tests
 
 ## Create typescript project
 In the terminal (confirm you're in the correct folder you want to be in, `ls`) paste
  > npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
 Make sure to change the 'my-app' bit 'todo-app' (or something that you want to name it to)

  - todo: add list of compoennts
 
 ## Use MUI to fill out the base components
